You are like a robot repeating what you&#39;ve been programmed to say. Why don&#39;t you actually look at what&#39;s in any of the Vaccines? Why don&#39;t you study each ingredients separately and look at the implications thereof?  Why don&#39;t you stop judging out of ignorance and actually use the biggest muscle in your body  - the brain.But you probably won&#39;t because you&#39;re lazy. You&#39;ve been trained to be lazy. Trained to go with the narrative of pharmaceutical and government bodies. You&#39;ve been trained to blindly follow and not to question.

Why don&#39;t you check out the flow charts the data concerning vaccinations timeliness and the common illnesses of the day  and look how low already  was before the vaccinations even came into being?  Also compare the timeline of vaccination, the instructions of the MMR and autism increase from 1975, following the flow charts up until now.  If you can rub 2 coins together you might be able to spark a brain cell, then you will quickly realise it was herd immunity caused by natural transmission which brought down diseases, and the vaccinations came largely after this was already established, taking credit for a natural occurrence.But you probably won&#39;t do any of this you&#39;re going to just repeat what you said to someone else or  come back with an ignorant comment.

I don&#39;t doubt that some doctors do things that are unethical - and they should be punished for it. But what you&#39;re doing is deflecting the focus onto doctors rather than the scientific evidence. 3. Releasing a list of ingredients in a vaccine literally accomplishes nothing . I could list all of the ingredients in your body, and that would enlighten absolutely nothing as to the safety and functionality of those ingredients in their bioactive forms. 4. An oral tablet is fine to you, but an injection isn&#39;t? As for your claim about it being &#39;better&#39;, please cite your sources. 5. You bring up that Mikovich had her license removed. And then you claim it was removed by Fauci. But again, you fail to realize that what you&#39;re doing is waving yours hands in the air and using your imagination to draw a grandiose conclusion from two separate things without any evidence to prove an underlying injustice/nefarious intention. Grandiose claims require similarly grandiose evidence. 6. I&#39;m advocating on behalf of evidence-based health practices because I am tired of watching South Africans die from preventable diseases. I&#39;m tired of watching charlatans use blatant lies dressed up in misused jargon and flashy documentaries to convince those who don&#39;t know any better to make decisions that not only affect their own health in a negative way, but the community&#39;s health as a whole.
